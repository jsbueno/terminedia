Targeted for next release (0.4):
=================================

[text-branch]

    - Refactor 'text.py' into directory:[WIP~
        - separate 'font' code into text/fonts.py (V)
        - text_planes/big text into text/planes.py (V)
        - file with text utilities for parsing/rendering text:
            - split string into units containing a single grapheme, by grouping "combining characters" together (V)
            - Refactor code to have a core to be used by  backend.print, screen.print, text.at, shape.print
    - Make assignment of string to shape or text area cell spread the text across as many cells as needed:[WIP]
        - correctly detect combining characters so that combined characters live on the same cell (V)
        - correctly detect if final transformed character takes more than 1 cell width after applying effects, and correctly use 2 cells for character
    - create markup language for embedding context changing directives inside a single string:
        - make it usable by assignment, `print` and `at` methods
    - Text entity, akim to "shape" or "sprite" which allows for flowing text [WIP]:
        - BUG: when rendering spaces, attributes (like background) are not updated (V) - fixed by sprite transparency handling implementation.
        - This can be current "text_planes" themselves [v]
        - these should be decorateable with frames using unicode frame drawing characters
        - Think of a way to "stream" text inside these containers [WIP]:
            - TM.text.StyledSequence is the class[v]
            - Streamed text should allow marks for changing style (color, bg, effects, direction)
                on the fly[wip]:
                    - accept tokens in embedded square-brackets in the string ex.: "abc[color:red]def[V]
                    - Accept absolute/relative movement with "[+x,+y]" tokens embedd in the string[V]
                    - allow for 'pop last parameter of this type' tokens ([/color], [/effects])[WIP]
                    - allow for default colors with [color:default] (V) (but check default-color bug bellow)
                    -

            - Apply transformers eagerly on a  per-character base (context-transformers are currently lazy, applied at
                        rendering time only, and are "flat" for the whole shape)
            - Allow a call to MLToken.parse to be passed a transformers-mapping, and us it as a source for
                    transformers objects in the  markup [transformer:...] elements
            - these marks can come embedded in the text, standalone
                    (and programatically depending on "tick count" or rendering position). or
            - these marks can be placed in the text_plane entity at fixed locations
                and compose with the styledtext rendering.
            - special marks should allow programatic text modfication based on ticks and position
            - end-of-lines are marked by special "portal" objects poiting the
                text to the beginning of the next line
                 - (teleporters also indicate the direction the remainder of the text will flow)

            - These "portal" are created automatically (lazily?) for
                    left-to-right, top-down text, but can be customized
                    for greater good and funny layouts
        - Think of a nice API to make use of TM.text.StyledSequence that is shorter than instantiating one, passing the screen.data.text[1] as text_plane kwarg, and calling "render" on it followed by "screen.update()" :-) (probably changing "print", "at" and "__setitem__" on .text to use it :-) ):
            - modify text_plane.at method to use styled sequence
            - fix and modify "=" in text_plane to use styled_sequence
            - modify "print" and "print_at" functions across the board to accept MLed text
        - create an ANSI Sequence parser based on the MLTkenizer parser.


    - create aliased string names for the text[...] text planes (V)
    - Make shape.text alone behave like shape.text[1], with no need for indexing.
    - Add tests to terminedia-planes [WIP]:
        - Avoid creating a new "Text" instance on each text-plane access!

    - pickle terminedia.unicode.CHAR_BASE as part of setup.py install (?)


[WIP]
Implement "big square" 2 block resolution:
make way for 6x3 block core transformers in order to use half-triangle characters

    - Document work around for use under windows (WIP)
    - Create color-reducing code so that colors (mostly) work
    - future: Windows terminal backend bypassing colorama, using full capabilities;
    - Fix windows keyboard handling on new- MS terminal (2019)
    - Known Issue: the rendering through colorama is super-slow. most animation applications will be just proof of concepts until another way is found.

- Refactor utils.py into proper folder [WIP]
- Efficient MutableString/struct container to replace "list" as main data storage [WIP]:
    - backed by bytearray
    - use abc.MutableSequence for and store utf-32-le data for characters
    - slice set/get uses strings
    - But how could this be ever faster than lists of one-character strings?? :-(
        - temptative:
            - abuse slice operations - these should go fast
            - change internal read operations to operate on row-chunks
            - make image.__getitem__ a special case of getting a single item and move
                most of its code to a method that operate on chunks.
                - make client methods (draw.blit, text.char_at, backend reading) use the chunky method



Resolve "can't output a lot of things to terminal if stdin set to non blocking" bug on windows

smaller features:
    - accept context attributes (color, background, effects) as keyword arguments on all .draw methods [WIP]:
        - create the concept of 'write_transformers': transformations
            to pixels at writting time in a separate context transformers stack
    - Make local contexts default to root context if a value has not been explicitly set
        - more important: make thread-local contexts default to values on the main (interactive) thread
        so that an event loop can be spawned in interactive mode and use proper context values
    - use the same option of suppressing absolute cursor movement for the html backend.
    - uniformize "size", "get", "set" and __getitem__ & __setitem__ on screen, shape, high and braille namespaces.
    - fix palleted shapes:
        - create proper booleanshape (true/false + color) - used by default to render fonts.
        - reading with __getitem__ should get back a pixel with the original character, but when blitting, only the color and boolean information should be blitted (color.TRANSPARENT should imply in "False" pixels)
        - on drawing, context.char should be respected - and auto-appended to the color_map if not there.
    - make emoji's and unicode chars easier to use:
        - expose unicodedata databases as plain dictionaries
    - enable "debug" flag in root context and display internal information on object's repr based on that
            (currently Screen's repr is showing last_pos, last_color, and other internal state attrs by default)
    - shape "clear" call:
        - optional parameter to reset text information

    - Fix in-function imports in place to avoid circular imports so that they only run once per process
    - Alias context.foreground to context.color

    - bug: html rendering not respecting context colors, on starting empty space characters
    - bug: with terminal in relative movement, snake-game is faulty,, suggesting terminal-context bugs
    - bug: (may be postponed) - shape.render does not respect shapesviews (slices): the parent shape is rendered instead

    Transformers:
        - include a variety of ready-to-use and easy to parametrize transformers for:
             -applying gradient effects (POC done)
             - convolution filters (POC done)
             -  Mapping that allows key/value pairs to have attached tags
                when using the tags in browsing (values, keys), a tag may be specifed
                to filter out any pairs that do not have the same tag.
                This should be useful for tagging sprites and the event system -
                and also for providing a single "transformers library" object
                using tags for the transformers categories.
            - Refactor Transformers.process so that the setup does not have to be
                repeated for each pixel. (an strategy like the used by
                StyledText.render will likely be possible):
                    - create a benchmarking script
                    - create a two-step process that yields a callback
                        with the signature of current Transformers.Process



        -Enhance transforners __repr__

    Sprites:
        - Add Spatial transformation


        - Spatial - class embedding a 2D (3X3) transformation matrix with friendly properties
                to specify linear transformations in a friendly way.

        - Find a way to attach sprites to other than native resolution - so
        that a normally rendered sprite, attached to "high" space will be drawn
        scaled down, on that space.

    create some filters as ready-made transformers (maybe not all for 0.3.0):
        - threshold: yield true/false pixels and strip color information
        - convert colorred fullblock pixels to "transparent" pixels: keep the existing char, and apply the color as background
        - color-value to different unicode-circles
        - color-value to different unicode-squares
        - linear gradients

    - Reactive rendering

        - per-backend "fast_render" method: called in place of the "_print" method, takes
        a list of rectangles and an image data source - caches color, bg, effects by itself
            (HTML Backend missing improvement. Current HTML usage, of pre-rendering a full frame
            would not take advantages from this, as there is no way to update
            an inner rectangle changing just some pixels from one frame to the next.
            Other totally new HTML renderings (e.g. using tables, Canvas, one ID for each character
                                                could benefit from fast_render)
            - relative-positioning for ANSI backend (TBD)

        - Use data structures to track dirty rectangles in a shape for fast_update =
                - have a specialized dirty_registry data structure (V)
                    - (internaly using a heapfied list - maybe an specializd data structure as a linked list would be better)
                - Missing tests for any of dirty-rect tracking features.
        - create "FrozenRect" and avoid usage of tuples-as-rects in code.

        - Speedup pixel-data retrieving from within shapes:
            - use a unique data-structure instead of 4 separate lists for fullshapes:
                - speed-up (or skip altogether) Pixel creation for each read.
        - fix other low hanging improvements visible with 'python -m profile terminedia-shapes
            - ex. avoid in-per-pixel methods use of "imports"


breaking-changes:
    - rename unicode effects so that their name matchs their unicode names (at least "super_bold" -> "regional_indicator")

3.1:
========
Write some real nice docs, with tutorials and use suggestions


Future
========

- MARKUP:
    Accept a markup in all string-printing methods to enable interleaving
    context changes during the print:
        - Example: "TM.print("Hello [color:red]World[/color][effect:blink]!!!")
        - Allow cursor movement commands into the markup
        - promote the current side-effect that if "context.char" is set
        to a string more than one glyph in length all the string is
        placed instead of a single pixel to a full feature, accepting
        this markup

- BACKENDS:
    Image 'screenshot' backend
        - including rendering animations as gifs or image-sequences
    image backend (pixels are simple color-only boring, image pixels)
    postscript backend
    .rtf backend
    pdf backend
    jupyter notebook backend
    Fallback terminal to 1-byte color setting for up to 216 colors + 24 grayscale
    - ANSI:
        - get the color, movement, and effects sequences from terminfo, and use hard-coded common sequences just as fallback. (thanks to Gilles Quenot)

- new "resolution modes":
    - half character (1/2 block - square aspect ratio)(V)
    - double-character (2 blocks - square aspect ratio)
        - Add a Text[2] plane using braille chars(WIP)
        - create a solution equivalent to the ".text[4]" plane selection for resolutions
    - sextant (1/6 block) (depends on unicode 12 with vintage charset), with square aspect ratio:
    - 1 block width x 1 block height at arbitrary 1/8 block height position. (use "LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK" and friends)
    - 1 block width x 1 block height at arbitrary 1/8 block width position.
    - refactor image loading to be able to use super-resolutions for B&W, while keeping color resolution low (Speccy way)
     - Update "text-effects" example to fit more effects to come.

- Event system
    Allow for CSS like animations, mainloop and callback registration
    for events

- System Font finding and auto-terminal config
    - Find a way to find witch unicode-glyphs are available in system-wide fonts
    - suggest font-installation
    - (or) download free-fonts to terminedia data folder (but how to make the host terminal use them?)
    - refactor unicode-translations to include correct information about the characters used, with links back to proper unicode documentation (including the motivation for theis inclusion)

Convolution-dependant effects: [WIP]
    - smooth-out corners
    - use unicode circles and squares to denote intensity
    - conversion to ASCII line-art with "/_\|" chars, and unicode version [WIP]
    - conversion to table chars (single and double-frame) [WIP]
    - Couple with "find border" filter(?)

"page" abstraction expanding the "shape": including text regions, layers and animation effects
    (possibly using sprites)

easy way to pick unicode emojis and glyphs

Enhance color and composition:
    alpha channel support for images:
    plot with spaces (" ") instead of full-block char, and compose color using background
    "combination modes"
    add easy color operations (modify RGB or HSL attributes of a given color in an easy way)

Sprites:
    create tagging system
    and easy tag-based event api

Improving Shape objects:
    - Change the internal representation of data in FullShape (if not other shapes) -
        - it is absoltely wasteful
        - check if Numpy can be used optionally without complicating too much the code (do not force Numpy data - Python arrays, or some ctypes Struct should be preferable)
             - Perceived problem - there is no "char array" in stdlib.array.
    - Add Shape public functions to retrieve the raw shape data in ways useful outside of terminedia, other than by rendering (shape.as_string? what about other attributes than chars?)

MS-Windows support (colorama/mscrvt/color reducing)[WIP]

"business" framed-window api

Basic image transform API: resize, rotate, flip.

Table drawing chars drawing API (maybe convert chars with a convolution after block-line art?) [WIP]

Super-high resolution (Unicode vintage charset and "sextant" blocks)

Mouse event support

Audio support (pyAudio?)

Image (shape) transform - (rotate, scale).

paint modes to use different characters to denote intensity (back do ascii art):
    - already possible via transformers [0.3.0dev0]
    unicode circles
    unicode squares
    Classic ASCII # * . etc
    Block-smoothing with half triangle block chars
    (use a context "paint mode" to have this supported on all paint operations?)
    (use a special "effects" attribute and apply a convolution variant with a transformer?)

"gradients": ways to make easy to create gradually changing colors.
             possibly a "painting context" similar to Cairo's, instead
             of a plain value for foreground color. Then color
             for each pixel could be sourced from a shape, image,
             gradient, whatever.
             But whatever is done, have ways for it being simpler to
             use than cairo's contexts.'
             (Hint: already possible on "user side" by using context-transformers)

replicate text-char effects for big-chars

Graph plotting CLI
    make terminedia available as a matplotlib backend

alpha emulation using background and color manipulation

gaming framework in general:
    (integrate as a backend to "jsbueno/mapengine"?)
    sprites
    physics engine (minimal, 2D)
    animation support
    main loop

"main loop":
    - event system
    - loop dependant 'blink like" animations: cicle colors, characters, text based on timing


space invaders implementation (hint: it would be already feasible - but it is still a "landmark" of the roadmap)


# virtual terminal server-
Advanced terminal handling features
    REPL Environment wit bottom lines for python console and upper screen for image (see posix_openpt)
    anmating and coloring text output of unaware apps, by creating an internal virtual terminal (posix_openpt)
    animating and coloring text output ... monkey patching a subprocess stdin, stdout and stderr.
    handle scrolling capabilities and pre-post buffer
    terminal agnostic screen commands (terminfo and infocmp to de-hardcode ANSI sequences)
    implement SIGWINCH signal handler to enable auto-resize/reflowing on terminal window size change:
        - check if there is a ms-windows equivalent

more features
###############
    Add text formatting and flowing primitives into ".text" namespace:
        method to allow text insertion and flowing inside a shape or ROI
        allow center/left/right/justify alignments
    Add scrolling, rectangular text regions and flowing text
    All-side scrolling and flowing text from one region to the next
    (make text.at work with the @ operator?: `sc.text[4] @ (5,2)("hello!")(?)
    Find proper API do render 8x16 pixel fonts into 8x8 char "high-resolution" 1/4 block.
    Add arbitrary font handling by using PIL to cache rendered chars.
    Enable 16 x 8 double and 16 x 16 double width UNSCII fonts.
    create a "blit fast path" for value/palette shapes to target (avoid overhead of pixel creation)
    make "Alpha" value work for value-shapes.
    make "intensity" rendering for values (B&W shapes)
    (them proceed to write the different backends.)
        - Accept 0-255 or 0-1.0 3 [4] sequences for RGB color [Alpha]
        - conversion to 1-byte standard 216 color palette for terminals
        - make use of 1byte color on terminal.py
    - make main user-facing classes: Shapes, Text, Transformers, Sprites, pickle serializable (and deep-copyable)

    Assume `set` method passed to drawing.Drawing can always accept pixels. Simplify workarounds in "image.ShapeApiMixin" and "screen.set_at" to accept pixels. (API breaking - change this before making a release)


Enhance EMOJI and multi-language support:
    - handle combining characters properly
    - document which terminal applications will have the best emoji experience (check kitty terminal app)

shape and page capabilities:
    create full fledged shape with char, fg, bg, effects (WIP - only missing example script):
        Add example script using FullShape and transformers(terminedia-text)
    create "Page" class: contaning several z-ordered shape or ROIs for text layout

- implement fix at drawing.blit (N/A - blit simply copies CONTINUATION constant normally)
- implement fix at terminal.Commands.print (N/A - 'CONTINUATION' constant never reaches terminal functions)
- [future]:
    - check double width chars at UNSCII 16 for proper use at other text scales
    - if needed implement the logic above at text[4], [8], etc...
