Future
========

multiple backends: (check pygments):
    ANSI backend (file or text string) (V)
    HTML backend (WIP)
    Image 'screenshot' backend
    image backend (pixels are simple color-only boring, image pixels)
    postscript backend
    .rtf backend
    pdf backend
    Fallback terminal to 1-byte color setting for up to 216 colors + 24 grayscale

new "resolution modes":
    - half character (1/2 block - square aspect ratio)
    - double-character (2 blocks - square aspect ratio)
    - braille-block (1/8 block)(WIP):
        - refactor "HighRes" class splittin a base class sub-pixel resolution agnostic (V)
        - refactor "BlockChars" to have a usefull superclass (V)
        - add equivalent class using Braille characters as 2x4 pixel blocks (V)
        - Add a provisional namespace "braille" for super-resolution (V)
        - Add a Text[2] plane using braille chars(WIP)
        - create a solution equivalent to the ".text[4]" plane selection for resolutions
    - sextant (1/6 block) (depends on unicode 12 with vintage charset), with square aspect ratio:
    - 1 block width x 1 block height at arbitrary 1/8 block height position. (use "LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK" and friends)
    - 1 block width x 1 block height at arbitrary 1/8 block width position.
    - refactor image loading to be able to use super-resolutions for B&W, while keeping color resolution low (Speccy way)

unicode latin-effected characters as character effects:
    (like digits and letters inside squares and circles, combining stroke, underline, slash, and so on)
    (should use the "Effects" space currently marking terminal-wise text effects,
     and be applied only at rendering time - "value_data" structures should retain page-0 range latin text)
     - encircled chars(V)
     - squared chars(V)
     - Reversed squared chars(V)
     - Refactor char translation engine to enable auto-generation of more unicode-alphabet families (WIP)
     - mathematical sans-serif bold italic (WIP - missing digits, think on refactoring)
     - Small (combining?) chars
     - Update "text-effects" example to fit more effects to come.
     - Fix internal data and cursor positioning for non-single width characters(V)
     - Allow manual selection of double-width chars (the "math-bold-italic" unicode group is listed as "single width", but does not look nice, would be better as double-width)

Find a way to find witch unicode-glyphs are available in system-wide fonts
    - suggest font-installation
    - (or) download free-fonts to terminedia data folder (but how to make the host terminal use them?)
    - refactor unicode-translations to include correct information about the characters used, with links back to proper unicode documentation (including the motivation for theis inclusion)

convolution-dependant effects, to smooth-out corners, use unicode circles and squares to denote intensity
    (should use transformers, and be applied at painting time)
"page" abstraction expanding the "shape": including text regions, layers and animation effects
easy way to pick unicode emojis and glyphs

alpha channel support for images:
    plot with spaces (" ") instead of full-block char, and compose color using background
Single-write optimization:(V)
    pass a "buffer" parameter around on the method-chain calls for screen rendering in the classes in Terminal.py (WIP)
    have an option to export the rendered buffer as a single block of bytes: a screenshot snapshot with built-in ANSI sequences.(V)
    Add an optional parameter to Screen.update (maybe rename the method to 'render'?) to draw to a string buffer instead of the terminal.(V)
support to z-index, and background keeping on blitting ("sprite" api)
MS-Windows support (colorama/mscrvt/color reducing)
"business" framed-window api
Postscriptish/Turtleish drawing api
Basic image transform API: resize, rotate, flip.
Table drawing chars drawing API (maybe convert chars with a convolution after block-line art?)
Super-high resolution (Unicode vintage charset and "sextant" blocks)
Mouse event support
Audio support (pyAudio?)
Image (shape) transform - (rotate, scale).
paint modes to use different characters to denote intensity (back do ascii art):
    unicode circles
    unicode squares
    Classic ASCII # * . etc
    Block-smoothing with half triangle block chars
    (use a context "paint mode" to have this supported on all paint operations?)
    (use a special "effects" attribute and apply a convolution variant with a transformer?)

"gradients": ways to make easy to create gradually changing colors.
             possibly a "painting context" similar to Cairo's, instead
             of a plain value for foreground color. Then color
             for each pixel could be sourced from a shape, image,
             gradient, whatever.
             But whatever is done, have ways for it being simpler to
             use than cairo's contexts.'
             (Hint: already possible on "user side" by using context-transformers)

replicate text-char effects for big-chars

frontend:
Graph plotting CLI
    make terminedia available as a matplotlib backend

alpha emulation using background and color manipulation

gaming framework in general:
    (integrate as a backend to "jsbueno/mapengine"?)
    sprites
    physics engine (minimal, 2D)
    animation support
    main loop

space invaders implementation (hint: it would be already feasible - but it is still a "landmark" of the roadmap)

        - refactor text effects flags to be iterable (V)
        - implement fix at FullShape.__setitem__, __getitem__ (V)

        - fix regression in high-res shape drawing(V)
        - [future]:
            - check double width chars at UNSCII 16 for proper use at other text scales
            - if needed implement the logic above at text[4], [8], etc...

    Improve error messages/or silence/ when attempting to write out of Screen/Shape limits
    FIX DOCUMENTATION GENERATION (V)
    generate documentation
    Add missing doc-strings
    improvement: API for  X-session wide key-repeat tunning with "xset r rate".
            (Maybe, in combination with other features, it is even possible to have keydown/keyup emulation)
            What is the equivalent API for Win and Mac if any?
    Make internal FullShape planes (and maybe other Shapes) specialized containers (they are plain lists): enable direct attribute setting on plane (rename  attributes in the process) (maybe trim further down shape class, and make internal planes for shapes, shapes as well?)
    Improve context transformers to become a friendly, stackable class
    create a few ready-made, parametrized transformers for effects like: plane select, color gradients, mask blit,
    Refactor "context" namespace into full class with descriptors. (V)

    Add a "clear" draw method to empty-up a target.
    Drawing APIs not respecting ShapeView limits (V)
    Optimize extent-limted blitting to skip fast to next shape line (by sending a next-line sentinel to shape-iterator) (V)
    add "callback" or early event system so that context parameters can be changed after printing a character, or other event.
    set up internal state on which terminal program is running, basd on env-vars (so that terminal behaviors bugs can be work-around)
    improvement: Screen.set_at should pass a pixel straight to __setitem__ and not set the context and pass only th value
    work on special methods to allow pickle serialization of shapes and maybe screens.
    have an ".update" method for .text and ".text[plane]" that will re-blit the contents into its .owner.data
    .text rendering should be transparent on unused pixels by default
    terminedia-image should resize to full screen-size when loading image (V))
    add an --output parameter to terminedia image to render output as ansi-laden txt file(V)


Color class Todo:
    - Create a color class (V)
    - Use color class in terminal commands(V)
    - Add support for html/css color names (V)
    - Add proper support for special constants: (default_bg, default_fg, etc...) (V)
    - use color class in html commands (V)
    - BUG: fix image-rendering to terminal using "default_fg" for black color.
    Future:

    - Add support for gray colors (single int)

        - Rewire "screen.__setitem__" to only actually output data within a call to ".update()" if the output is not to terminal: so that other backends than terminal don't require writting to ".data" (?)
    re-write functionalities of Commands and logic of Journaling commands for HTML (V)
    Parametrize Screen so it can have an HTML commands backend
    Implement HTML render output for files in images.Shape (V)
    Change terminedia-image example script to accept a "-backend HTML" option and create an HTML file.(V)

    future

    Refactor rendering mechanism to speed things up (0.2 sec/frame = 10 times too slow)
    Render with a separate CSS block and classes instead of inlining style in all tags.
    WSGI compatible server and javascript snippet to enable frame rendering and update
    keyboard and mouse event handling on server.
    create HTML Canvas output (?)

Bugs:
    bug: CRITICAL: effects refactoring led rendering to be B&W (V)
    bug: unicode_effects not being applied on direct "screen.print" call.(V)
    Bug: current "inkey" is buggy as repeated keystrokes are bundled in the same inkey response. (completly bork at higher repeat rates)(V)
    bug: re-entering a screen context and blitting  is not rendering the char at [0,0] (V)
    bug: Terminedia-shape with custom shape may trigger "going left" after going up or down. (V)
    bug: blitting full-shape to full-shape destroys characters and keep only blocks (V)
    bug: Terminedia-image not proper resampling images (getting out of range errors for full-sized images)(V)
    bug: plot example script prints completly bogus values on the y scale.
    bug:fix printing of colored double-width characters . (b0rk on konsole) (WIP)
    bug: colors in the 0-255 range are not working as terminedia-text value for color option
    bug: when apple shows up over snake body, it is erased from screen (snake.py) (easy) (external) (hacktober)
    bug: PGMShap class incorrectly using "default color" for black pixels (termined-image default loading is broken after refactoring to use Color class)

Bugs-external (report issue):

    Pypy3 regular expressions'split does not work with forward look-ahead (used in terminal rendering to slice a string at ESCape sequences) (resolved - not a PyPy3 Py3.6 bug: re.split is a nw thing in Python 3.7
