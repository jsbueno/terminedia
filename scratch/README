Scripts using during development for iteractive testing
=======================================================

Scratch scripts which will call  upon w.i.p. features, and
try some of the edge-case parameters. 

These are not "polished" products although they 
can be used as an example source on how
to use certain features.


Disclaimer:
-----------
Scripts in this folder may be a mess and that is ok!
