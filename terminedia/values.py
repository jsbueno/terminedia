    Contains a listing and other mappings of all block characters used in order, so that

    Although this class is purposed for internal use in the emulation of
    a higher resolution canvas, its functions can be used by any application
    that decides to manipulate block chars.

    The class itself is stateless, and it is used as a single-instance which
    uses the name :any:`BlockChars`. The instance is needed so that one can use the operator
    ``in`` to check if a character is a block-character.
